# TFM Chromohalobacter salexigens MADOBIS

## Project Description 

This repository contains the code and data used for my Master's Thesis, which focuses on a RNA-Seq of the halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter salexigens. The primary goal of the study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in this organism. 
The project involves processing biological data, running sequence alignments, and performing statistical analyses to understand the underlying molecular pathways. Below you'll find detailed instructions on how to reproduce the analyses. 

I used the Linux environment on Windows through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to conduct RNA-Seq analysis. Starting with the Illumina raw data in .fastq format, I processed it step by step, ultimately generating count data in an Excel file. 

This will be the first file encountered in the repository: a txt script that outlines, step by step, the code used to process the raw, unfiltered data. Based on a series of commands executed in WSL.
